You are a senior full-stack engineer, product architect, and startup CTO.

Build a mobile-responsive, production-ready MVP web application called “Novi”.

Novi is a real estate lease-transfer marketplace where CURRENT tenants list their residential or commercial rental units to find replacement tenants to assume or novate their lease, subject to OWNER APPROVAL.

IMPORTANT LEGAL POSITIONING:
- Novi is NOT a real estate broker
- Novi does NOT negotiate rent
- Novi facilitates lease transfers only
- Owner approval is mandatory before listings go live
- Novi charges the INCOMING tenant a platform fee upon successful transfer
